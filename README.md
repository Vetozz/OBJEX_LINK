> Note: OBJEX Link is still under development, so documentation may vary over time.

## What is OBJEX Link?
OBJEX Link is a modular IoT board. Is designed for every user who needs compact hardware for your smart projects. The form factor of OBJEX Link is meant to fit several applications. With modules, the user can customize easily the hardware for your projects.

## What I cand do with OBJEX Link?
Applications:
- IoT Button
- Weather station
- Smart Spotlight
- Security camera
- Motor driver
- Brightness detector
- RGB LED Strip controller
- Smart relay

### Modules
![alt text](https://github.com/salvatoreraccardi/OBJEX_LINK/blob/main/dir/2.jpg)

I have developed two types of modules to get the maximum hardware customization. In this way, it is possible to add two M0-type modules and one M1 module only.
- M0(10x20mm)(5V/3V3)
- M1(20x20mm)(5V/3V3)

### SlimStack
![alt text](https://github.com/salvatoreraccardi/OBJEX_LINK/blob/main/dir/3.jpg)

Each slimstack connector has 16 pins + 4 for the power bus which can supply up to 5A.

# FAQ

### Why use OBJEX Link and not another product like Arduino?
OBJEX Link was designed to develop smart devices and not for prototyping as you can see there are no GPIO connectors or stuff like that. With external modules, you can decide which device will become OBJEX Link, like a weather station, smart motor driver, Smart button, etc.

### OBJEX Link is open source?
All modules are open source in this way every user can design your module for a specific application. Also, all 3D projects designed for OBJEX LINK are open source.
